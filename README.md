# EduPay AI

AI-powered education payment assistant that converts natural-language education payment requests into structured payment plans and connects them with PayPal Sandbox.

## Overview

EduPay AI helps users plan education payments using natural language.

A user can describe an education payment request such as:

> I need to pay $999 for an advanced AI certification course. I want to split it into 3 equal installments.

EduPay AI uses AI to understand the request and generate:

- Total payment amount
- Number of installments
- Installment amount
- Currency
